This project is the implementation of a turbo code, an error correction code.

============
Structure:

all java files are in src and are used this way:

	- Cst contains all parameters used in the algorithm (including the permutation and both convolutifs coders
	- Coder and Decoder are used to encode and decode the message
	- Canal add noise in the signal by introducing errors in the message
	- Diff gives the number of errors in the decoded message
	- CoderConv represents the convolutif coder that is used
	- Help provides some debugging tools to print the state of convolutif coders for example
